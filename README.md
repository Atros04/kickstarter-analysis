# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Crowdfunding has been seen as a hit-and-miss system of getting funds for passion projects. *Fever* is one such project where funding was a hit, but how well did we do against other programs that attempted to crowdfund? I wanted to give us an idea of how certain times of the year could affect funding as well as comparing how our funding goal matched to the other plays that have hit Kickstarter.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Time was not really a factor for failed kickstarters. We consistently saw between 30 and 50 failed kickstarters per month among all the data; no one month stood out as a "failure" month over the others. However, we do see a larger uptick of successful plays during the spring months. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Play goals are even more of a mixed bag as we can see the graph showing no readable trendline. Part of this has to do with how few plays were in the funding goals past the $15,000 mark. We counted low twenties after being in triple digits just before that; this low count of plays makes the graph skew and appear to report that successful plays come back at the $35,000-$44,999 marks. Those successful plays were compared against 3 other plays across that range of goal funding. ![The chart shows nothing statistically significant](https://github.com/Atros04/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
