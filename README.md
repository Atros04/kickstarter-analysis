## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Crowdfunding has been seen as a hit-and-miss system of getting funds for passion projects. *Fever* is one such project where funding was a hit, but how well did we do against other programs that attempted to crowdfund?

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Play goals are even more of a mixed bag as we can see th

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
